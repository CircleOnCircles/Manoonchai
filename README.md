Modern &amp; Productive Thai keyboard layout

## Why?

Most of the problems are like problems with QWERTY layout, both Kedmanee & Pattachote layouts are: 

- Invented for typewriters which have been long gone these days
- Very old (50+ years!)
- tba

## Key Features

- Use Arabic numbers by default
- No Thai alphabets on number row
- Deprecated characters are moved to AltGr layer (eg. `๚`, `ฃ`, `ฅ`, `๛`)
- Tested with modern dataset
- Support all keyboard form factors down to 40%
